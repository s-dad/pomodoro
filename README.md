# Pomodoro Timer 
The Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool, which uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

<br/>

## Features
- Customizable work and break intervals
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Visual and auditory notifications for session changes
- Simple and user-friendly interface

<br/>

## What I Learned 📚
- Handling and updating the timer's state for different actions (start, pause, reset).
- Using JavaScript's setInterval and clearInterval functions to create the countdown.
- Implementing sounds to alert the user when intervals ends.
